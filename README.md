# PINN_solid_mechanics
Physics Informed Deep Learning model for solid mechanics

We utilize physics informed neural networks to solve the strong form of the equilibrium equation for a hyperelastic model. We solve the ODE for a dogbone specimen under tension.

The figure below presents the architecture of our PINN.
